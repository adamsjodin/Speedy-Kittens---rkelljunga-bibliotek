# Speedy-Kittens---rkelljunga-bibliotek
We have made our plan entirely using github projects, everything can be found under the project linked to this repository.
The collaborators on this project are Adam S, Martina and Rolf. 

## Definition of done:
- Unit tested according to User Stories
- Tested in all available browsers
- Short documentation on the work process
- The code has been reviewed by coworker
- The code has been integrated into the main branch
- We also included individual ideas of what makes each User Story done aside from the large definition

## Sprint goal: 
The sprint goal is to have a functional system for loaning books complete with search functionality.

## Our thought process:
We planned this sprint in a scenario where we are a team of 3 senior devs who got this task, we decided to plan our first sprint over a 2 week period. 
1 point = 1 day of work for 1 dev. 
We have accounted for work across 30 points for the 2 week period. 
We broke down our user stories into smaller TO-DO's tied to the story, we numbered these according to a system where user story 1's tasks are numbered 1.1, 1.2 etc. 
Each TO-DO also has a label with the estimated time score on it.
